        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Mark Younce. I'm a father, a husband, and an author. My journey as a writer began through the need to share the complex and often harsh realities of my life, especially my daughter Chloe's battle against brain cancer. My writing isn't just storytelling; it's a deep exploration of survival, resilience, and love — often the love that hurts but also saves us.</p>

        <p>My work often reflects my experiences standing on the precipice for my daughter, navigating uncertainty and wrestling with my own inner battles. I've also published pieces with <em>CURE Magazine</em>, which share both the emotional and practical sides of caring for a child facing the unthinkable. My daughters, Chloe and Leia, overflow with resilience and a bright spirit that infuse my work — they are my inspirations and my guiding light.</p>

        <p>In addition to these narratives, I've delved into poetry that captures the raw intensity of love, endurance, and resilience. My poems are deeply personal, revealing my experiences, both struggles and accomplishments, with mental health alongside my own growth and understanding of love. They reflect the human experience in all its intensity and vulnerability.</p>

        <p>Alongside my writing, I draw on my background in nuclear engineering and data science to contribute to healthcare innovation, particularly in pediatric oncology. I'm driven by the desire to make a difference, blending personal insight from Chloe's journey with professional expertise to help improve outcomes for children battling cancer.</p>

        <p>Writing is my outlet — a way to process and transform difficult experiences into something that might help others. My stories are for those navigating love, survival, and the messy, beautiful realities of being human. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope my work resonates with you.</p>
